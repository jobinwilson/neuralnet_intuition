# neuralnet_intuition
Build a strong intuition of how Neural Networks actually work.We start with the idea of visually fitting a function to some data, then introduce the idea of a "loss function". We minimize loss manually (using sliders) for a small quadratic function by eyeballing and then introduce gradient descend as a generic solution for automating this.
